# **Data Science Portfolio**

This repository contains my data science portfolio, showcasing projects across various domains, including food order analysis, EdTech industry analysis, and a recommendation system for Amazon products. Each project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## **Projects**

### **1. Food Order Analysis with Google Colab**
This project involves analyzing a dataset from a food delivery platform to derive insights into customer ordering patterns and business performance. The analysis covers revenue trends, order frequency, and high-value customer identification.

#### **Key Objectives**
- Identify the most frequently ordered items.
- Analyze peak order times and revenue trends.
- Determine high-value customers based on order frequency and total spend.

#### **Process Overview**
- **Data Loading**: Mounted Google Drive and loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and corrected data inconsistencies.
- **EDA**: Generated summary statistics, visualized order distributions, and revenue trends.
- **Visualization**: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create bar charts, line plots, and histograms.

#### **Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab

### **2. EdTech Industry Hypothesis Testing**
This project focuses on statistical analysis and hypothesis testing in the EdTech sector. The goal is to validate key business hypotheses about user engagement and course completion rates, providing data-driven insights to improve user experience.

#### **Key Objectives**
- Test whether course completion rates differ significantly across user segments.
- Analyze the relationship between engagement metrics and user retention.

#### **Process Overview**
- **Hypothesis Formulation**: Defined null and alternative hypotheses for various business questions.
- **Statistical Testing**: Conducted t-tests and ANOVA to validate hypotheses.
- **Visualization**: Presented results using box plots, histograms, and scatter plots.

#### **Technologies Used**
- Python (SciPy, Statsmodels, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

### **3. Amazon Product Recommendation System**
This project involves building a recommendation system for Amazon products using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches. The aim is to suggest relevant products to users based on their past interactions and product attributes.

#### **Key Objectives**
- Build a collaborative filtering model using user-item interaction data.
- Implement a content-based recommender using product descriptions and metadata.
- Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics.

#### **Process Overview**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the user-item interaction matrix.
- **Model Development**: Implemented collaborative filtering using matrix factorization techniques.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Extracted features from product metadata and computed similarity scores.
- **Evaluation**: Measured the accuracy of recommendations using precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### **Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
