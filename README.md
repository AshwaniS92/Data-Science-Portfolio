# **Food Order Analysis with Google Colab**

This project involves the analysis of a dataset related to food orders using **Google Colab**. The dataset, `foodhub_order.csv`, is processed and explored to derive insights into customer orders, order trends, and other important metrics.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and basic data processing on food order data. This can help businesses understand customer behavior, identify order patterns, and improve overall service.

The project includes:

- Loading data from Google Drive in Google Colab.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualizing key metrics and trends.

## **Features**

- **Data Loading**: The notebook mounts Google Drive and reads the dataset directly from it.
- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration includes checking the dataset's structure, missing values, and basic statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs are used to visualize key insights.
- **Insights Extraction**: Key takeaways from the analysis are documented.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

### **Step 2: Open the Notebook in Google Colab**

1. Upload the Jupyter notebook (`LowCode.ipynb`) to your Google Drive.
2. Open it with **Google Colab**.

### **Step 3: Upload the Dataset**
Ensure that the dataset (`foodhub_order.csv`) is uploaded to your Google Drive.

### **Step 4: Run the Notebook**
1. Mount your Google Drive in the first cell.
2. Update the file path if necessary to correctly point to the dataset.
3. Run all cells sequentially.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## **Usage**

1. After opening the notebook in Google Colab, ensure that your Google Drive is mounted correctly.
2. Run each cell to load the data, process it, and visualize key metrics.
3. Modify or extend the analysis as needed.

## **Data Dictionary**

The dataset `foodhub_order.csv` contains the following columns:

| Column Name       | Description                                   |

| `Delivery Status` | Status of the order (e.g., Delivered, Pending)|

## **Analysis Goals**

The analysis in this project focuses on:

- Identifying the most frequently ordered items.
- Analyzing order trends over time.
- Calculating total revenue generated.
- Understanding customer purchasing behavior.

## **Results and Insights**

- **Top-Selling Items**: Certain items were identified as the most frequently ordered.
- **Peak Order Times**: Specific days and times showed higher order volumes.
- **Revenue Trends**: Revenue patterns over time were visualized to understand business performance.
- **Customer Insights**: High-value customers and frequent buyers were identified.
